## About
ccol is a collection of the basic data structures you would find
in any modern high level programming language.

For now ccol contains implementation of Binary Tree (AVLTree),
Linked List (doubly linked list) and Vec (dynamically sized array).

Future additions to the library would be Hash Map and Hash Set.

## About
ccol is a collection of the most basic data structures you would find
in any modern high level language.

For now ccol contains implementation of self balanced binary tree (AVLTree),
Linked List (doubly linked list the only one that matters), HashTable.

Future additions to the library would be dynamically sized array aka vector,
HashSet.
